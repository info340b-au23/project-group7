# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

This is a proposal for INFO 340 BA Group7, presenting problem domain and app descriptions for a car automatch webpage implemented with HTML and CSS.

Our goal is to provide the best recommendation for someone who wants to buy a car.
