        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p> In today's fast-paced world, the process of selecting the proper automobile can be difficult and time-consuming for individuals. 
            Car purchasers frequently face the problem of sorting through a huge selection of car models, features, and specifications to 
            discover a vehicle that actually meets their wants and preferences. Traditional vehicle shops and internet markets provide 
            little support in this sense, leaving customers confused and overwhelmed. The problem at hand is the inefficiency and lack of
            user-centricity in the car selection process. 
        </p>
        <p>The challenge lies in the absence of a user-friendly, data-driven solution that allows real-time car matching based on individual preferences.
            Current platforms lack the ability to efficiently compare multiple car options. Existing car platforms primarily offer static listings and reviews,
            with limited interactivity. Some provide car comparisons, but these lack real-time updates and user-centric features. To address these issues,
            we propose "Car AutoMatch." This web app will use real-time data, a comprehensive car database, and user accounts to revolutionize the car selection process,
            making it efficient and user-centric.
